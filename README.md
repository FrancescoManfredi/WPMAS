# WP-MAS
## WordPress Multi Agent System communication plugin

This is a project for my Autonomous Intelligent Agents class @UNIVAQ

### What does it do
You can install this plugin in a WordPress website to send messages to a
multiagent system about events such as new content published, new comments,
new users or new websites views.

Messages are sent via sockets.

Take a look at [basicJadeMAS](https://github.com/FrancescoManfredi/basicJadeMAS)
for an example of how to receive messages on the MAS end.
